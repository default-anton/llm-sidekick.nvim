                                                        *:Chat*
:Chat [args] [paths] Opens a new buffer for general conversation with the LLM.
                    Perfect for brainstorming, creative writing, or any
                    non-technical discussions. Arguments can be:
                    - Model alias: any defined alias from configuration
                      (e.g., claude, fast, o1, mini, flash)
                    - Opening mode: tab (t), vsplit (v), split (s)
                    File content can be included by passing paths to files or
                    directories. Multiple file paths can be added. Example:
                    `:Chat %` to include the current file, `:Chat file1.txt
                    file2.lua` to include two specific files, or `:Chat %:h` to
                    include all files in the current directory recursively.

                    - URL to documentation or other web content
                    Must be used after an :Ask or :Code command.

:Apply              Applies file modifications from the modification block
                    containing the cursor. Only available in buffers created

:Stt                Starts speech-to-text recording at the current cursor
